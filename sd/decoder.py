'''
NOTE: Purpose of normalisation layers

Aim: To prevent distribution shift between layers which will cause instability to loss function. Normalisation
aims to stabilise the values received by each layer distributed around 0 with a variance of 1 --> N(0,1)

Batch Normalisation: Normalise by columns (features)
Layer Normalisation: Normalise by rows (data items)
Group Normalisation: Like Layer Normalisation, but not all of the features and only grouped features

Why? Because output of convolution comes from a local region.
Hence, closer features have the same distribution but further features
may not.
